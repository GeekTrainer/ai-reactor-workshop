# Section 3: Face API

One of the more common challenges companies look to solve revolves around facial recognition. This could be apps which allow for a form of mixed reality, where hats or other features are placed on a face. Or maybe you're looking to guess how someone is feeling at the moment to track feedback. Or, of course, you might be looking to determine who someone is in a picture. Microsoft Face API can help you with all of those challenges.

In this module we'll use our existing Flask application to test Face API. We'll create a simple UI for training facial recognition, and then test it out by trying to detect a couple of faces.

To add the functionality, you will:

1. Learn about [Face API](./introduction.md)
2. Learn about [facial recognition](./facial-recognition-concepts.md)
3. [Train a model](./train-face-api.md)
4. [Add face detection](./detect-face-api.md)
5. [Test and deploy the site](./deploy.md)
