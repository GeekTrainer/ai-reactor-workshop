# Section 3: Face API

One of the more common challenges companies look to solve revolves around facial recognition. This could be apps which allow for a form of mixed reality, where hats or other features are placed on a face. Or maybe you're looking to guess how someone is feeling at the moment to track feedback. Or, of course, you might be looking to determine who someone is in a picture. Microsoft Face API can help you with all of those challenges.

In this module we'll use our existing Flask application to test Face API. We'll create a simple UI for training facial recognition, and then test it out by trying to detect a couple of faces.
