# Welcome to the Microsoft Reactor Artificial Intelligence Workshop!

We're glad you're here!

## What to expect

This will be a one-day, expert led session where you'll explore Artificial Intelligence (AI) and [Cognitive Services](https://azure.microsoft.com/en-us/services/cognitive-services/), how to integrate AI into your applications, when to create your own Machine Learning (ML) models, all by walking through a set of examples built on [Python](https://python.org).

## Prerequisites

We make no assumptions about your level of knowledge when it comes to AI or ML. This course is built assuming you're curious about this emerging technology, but haven't necessarily experienced it first hand. Or maybe you're already using similar services on another cloud provider and want to explore Microsoft's offerings.

The course does assume you are familiar with a programming language, such as Java, Ruby, or C#. We will be using Python, but no Python experience is required. We chose Python because it's an extremely popular language, especially in this space, and it's one whose syntax is relatively readable. We have provided a [primer on Python](./intro-python.md) and [Flask](./intro-flask.md) (which we use for the website you'll be creating) to help get you started.

## System requirements

You can follow along with the coding demos on your own systems. In order to do so, you'll need a couple of locally installed resources:

- [Python](./install-python.md)
- Code editor, such as [Visual Studio Code](https://code.visualstudio.com/)
- [Azure Command Line Interface (CLI)](https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/cli/azure/install-azure-cli?view=azure-cli-latest)
- [Starter site](./install-starter.md)
- [Launch the starter](./starting-site.md)

## Course modules

1. [Overview of Artificial Intelligence](./overview.md)
2. [Using Computer Vision and Translator Text](./computer-vision-translator/README.md)
3. [Face Identification with Face API](./face-api/README.md)
